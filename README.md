# Data Preprocessing with NumPy

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains a hands-on project focused on **cleaning and preprocessing data** using **NumPy** to prepare it for a machine learning model. The dataset used in this project is a loan dataset, which undergoes various preprocessing steps to handle missing values, normalize data, and structure it for ML applications.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Loading and inspecting data**: Using `numpy.genfromtxt()` to import structured data.
- **Handling missing values**: Replacing or imputing missing data efficiently.
- **Data transformation**: Applying mathematical operations to normalize and scale data.
- **Filtering and selection**: Extracting relevant features for the model.
- **Saving preprocessed data**: Exporting the clean dataset for ML models.

## ðŸš€ Why Use NumPy for Data Preprocessing?
NumPy is a **powerful and efficient** library for handling numerical data. Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s ideal for preprocessing:
- **Performance**: Faster than traditional loops for handling large datasets.
- **Vectorized operations**: Enables efficient mathematical transformations.
- **Memory efficiency**: Uses optimized memory structures.
- **Seamless integration**: Works well with other libraries like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow.
